            <p>Hello! My name is Pranav Viswanathan, and I am currently a junior attending Dublin High School. Over the past couple years, I have had many inspirations in several job fields, but the one that really fits me the best is the envision of becoming a business product manager. Even though there are multiple routes to approach this line, the one that would be the most “prepared” route in my opinion would go from starting off basic by taking college classes and high school classes related to the field (which I currently do both), earning a minor degree in computer science, and a major in management/business, and lastly completing an MBA in management, which would ultimately lead me to a better foundation approaching the job. The main purpose behind my drive to be in this field is particularly due to a dream that I’ve always wanted to accomplish, which is owning a business. Though it doesn’t come easy, and it is not necessarily related to the product management line as a whole, the leadership skills that come with owning that business, are some of the qualities that I possess that can make me a standout candidate.</p>

            <p>Being a part of two clubs, which includes Dublin High Hockey and the Best Buddies Club (BB), these two outside activities from associated school events has really developed myself to the person I am today, with multiple characteristics. Upon joining hockey, it was a very confusing process at the start, in which I was very new to how the club worked in general, and how everything was set up. However, as the first year passed by through sophomore year after bonding with teammates, creating memories, etc, this all came into play for what leads to year two. Within the team, many of the guys were very laid back, and often didn’t take the drive to organize activities, and help out the team in general. That is when I realized I can take the initiative to do the following in junior year, as I became the ringman in organizing meetings, and giving introductions for our new players, as well as for those who never had a clue about what the game was. In addition, I have also contributed to the design of accessories that would be given to us in the near future for our gear, which comes to show the idea of strategic planning and designing. Being a leader, and more importantly, being responsible and stepping up to the plate is what lead to me to have a bigger role within our team in the current situation.</p>

            <p>I have always had a passion for being able to educate people, as well as serving the community in anyway possible. With this drive, I joined the Best Buddies Club, which is a group that meets every week to create a bonding relationship with special education students, and teach them, but more importantly create a loving environment. Upon joining this club, I met a student by the name of Thomas, who was very excited and always had a smile on his face every time I saw him. By working with him for a couple of months, I was able to create a good relationship between each other as well as educating him in all ways possible, such as playing kickball, or playing cards, etc. All of these qualities define who I have become as a person, and what I am capable of for being the primary figure in the workforce.</p>

            <p>The club involvement that I have had so far during my time in high school is definitely an unforgettable experience, as I have learned so much about how to truly express myself,and being able to create change. In conclusion, thank you readers for your time to getting to know a little bit about myself, and my aspirations. Feel free to navigate the rest of my website to see what accomplishments I have done so far!!</p>
