        <p><strong>Class:</strong> Computer Science Principles (CSP)</p>
        <p><strong>Time Given:</strong> 1 1/2 of a week given.</p>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To construct an application expansion within the timeframe. More depth provided below.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <p>One of the projects that I have created during my Computer Science Principles class was the PaintPot Extension with Camera application, which was an app that was emphasized on the original, giving more features for the user to access rather than solely the camera and a set of 3 colors only.</p>
        
        <p>Made through MIT App Inventor, the project was very easily completed, yet some of the features that were suggested by both my partner Jeffrey Chang and myself were not going to be a reality. MIT App Inventor was quite a new software for me, so understanding how everything worked took time, but eventually worked out in the end. It is very relatable to Scratch, except with a little more minor setbacks and pros.</p>

        <p>Between the two of us, I was mainly the organizer, planner, and structural designer of the project, while Jeffrey did most of the coding. To start this off, the main thing I really wanted to focus on at the initial stages for what we had was the set of colors. When given the default setup of the project, we had only red, blue, and green. We ended up adding violet, which gave a little bit more variety, as well as the creation of the RGB button. I thought about making this idea, and as my partner agreed, we made it so that when the button is clicked every time, the color automatically changes. Though this was a creative idea from the start, my partner did have suggestions about a dropdown menu for selecting any color on the RGB scale, but we ended up realizing that it would be very complicated. In the end for the colors, I finalized that we should simply stick with the button as it is simple to use.</p>

        <p>In addition to the camera, we added features of selecting from the camera roll rather than simply taking pictures, and having to erase it all, in addition to background erase and “doodle” erase. I suggested these features, and we both agreed on them for simplicity for the user interface. Lastly comes the addition of the brush thickness, where we both agreed on doing this, however problems arose. The way we wanted the brush to show up when it was very thick was very odd shaped, as we dragged the paint across the screen. We tried multiple methods to fix this, but it was left as is. This basically sums up the additions to the project, by adding more user friendly features, as well as creativity.</p>

        <p>After completing this project, I learned a lot about what it takes to formulate ideas for the project, as well as working successfully as a team. Though we did have a lot of ideas between the both of us, I ended up deciding whether it was easily doable or not, and we put them to the test, and sought the reliability of each feature for the user to have. Relating back to the field of interest of my eyes, which is a product manager, being able to facilitate and give structures for what you want to create is exemplified in this project, as my role was a big part of what we had to finish it off. In addition, the communication that was presented between the both of us to get our logs and data recorded, was also successful, which is another important job of entering this position.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time to looking into the schematics of my project! Feel free to look around anywhere else on my page.</p>
